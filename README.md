# Heavy Drinking Detection from Smartphone Accelerometer Data

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of time-series accelerometer data collected from smartphones to identify movement patterns indicative of heavy drinking episodes. The data has been meticulously cleaned and prepared to ensure accurate analysis. The following techniques were employed:

- **Permutation Entropy and Complexity Metrics:** These methods were applied to differentiate between sober and intoxicated states, enabling the detection of sensitive movement axes that are affected by alcohol consumption.
- **Privacy-first Tool Development:** The ultimate goal of the project is to create a privacy-conscious tool that helps monitor and track drinking habits, based on smartphone sensor data.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of accelerometer data.
- Application of permutation entropy and complexity metrics to detect differences in movement patterns.
- Development of a tool for monitoring heavy drinking episodes while maintaining user privacy.
